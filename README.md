When testing website changes, it's helpful to quickly check them in all main browsers. 

## Instructions

Using the keyword `3b` followed by a URL, you can quickly launch Safari, Chrome and Firefox to test your changes.

Need to add or change browsers? Open an existing `Open URL` object and choose another browser from the dropdown, or connect a fourth one to add another.

The Conditional Utility checks whether you've included https or http in your URL, and adds it if necessary.
